              EHT Resolves Central Jet from Black Hole in Cen A
            </h5>

              How do supermassive black holes create powerful jets? To help find
              out, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaged the center of the
              nearby active galaxy Centaurus A. The cascade of featured inset
              images shows Cen A from it largest, taking up more sky than many
              moons, to its now finest, taking up only as much sky as an golf
              ball on the moon. The new image shows what may look like two jets
              -- but is actually two sides of a single jet. This newly
              discovered jet-edge brightening does not solve the jet-creation
              mystery, but does imply that the particle outflow is confined by a
              strong pressure -- possibly involving a magnetic field. The EHT is
              a coordination of radio telescopes from around the Earth -- from
              the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory in Hawaii USA, to ALMA in
              Chile, to NOEMA in France, and more. The EHT will continue to
              observe massive, nearby black holes and their energetic
              surroundings.
